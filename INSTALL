# How to Install
Put "cto_plugin.py" and "cto_func_lister_plugin.py" and the "cto" folder including the files and folders under it into the "plugins" folder of IDA's user directory ($IDAUSR).  
If you use IDA 8.5 or later and want to manage this plugin with a directory, copy "cfl_plugin" and "cto_plugin" to "plugins", move "cto_func_lister_plugin.py" into "cfl_plugin", move "cto_plugin.py" into "cto_plugin" as well as the step above.

See the URL if you don't know about "$IDAUSR".
